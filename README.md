WEB Design Project
what I want is for U to create
1. a main page(home page) in that have a option in the top left corner for settings. 
use a gear as a button and animate it when ever I hover my mouse on it. The settings should have an  options for frames (15,30,60). On the bottom right  of the page introduced a fake countdown for the next big space mission to mars. Make it look futersitic. 
2. After the main page I want is a 3D Solar system where I can zoom in and out of planets I should be able to see the sun and all the 8 planets. And if U can make the the planets spin on their axis for realistic affects. on the buttom right corner have a option for feature like where ever my mouse is it will tell me the distance from the sun. Make all the planets clickable and even the sun. When ever I claick on a planet or the sun there should be zooming in animation.
3. After I click on the planet the planet should still be rotating and on the right side some information about it. Like the missions, distance from the sun, fun facts, etc.
also let the user also rotate the planet with its mouse.
4. Make it look awsome go all out and for the background keep it starfield all the time.
